/**
 * SS Practice: F7's first device, Simon Says, summoned in front of you with a keybind (press it
 * again to take it away), to practice anywhere. Entirely visual: no block of the world is changed,
 * not even in your own copy of it. The device's blocks are only drawn ([Placement.blocks]), what
 * you look at on it is raycast after the game's own pick ([afterPick]), and clicks on it are
 * handled here and cancelled before the game would send anything (no use, no swing, no mining).
 *
 * The device is its 4x4 obsidian grid in a wall of black wool, with the start button on the wool
 * left of the grid, placed where it is from the spot healers stand on to do it (108, 120, 94 in the
 * arena, facing +x) and turned to face whichever way you look. [solver] is Odin's Simon Says
 * solution drawn on it: Odin's own only works on the real one.
 *
 * How it plays, as measured from recordings of real P3 runs:
 *  - The start button is left of the grid. Presses in the 6 ticks after the first decide the
 *    first show: 1 press shows round 1; 2 or 3 show one stray light first, then the first 1 or 2
 *    of the sequence (the "skip": 3 presses, press 2, then rounds of 3 and 4).
 *  - Lights: one every 8 ticks. Buttons: all 16 come back 10 ticks after the last light goes out;
 *    after a show that started with a stray light they come 5 ticks after the last light comes on,
 *    except that light's own button, which waits until 10 ticks after it goes out.
 *  - A pressed button stays down 3 ticks (pressing it again meanwhile does nothing).
 *  - The next round starts 6 ticks after the round's last correct press; after round 4 (Hypixel's
 *    Oct 2026 update removed round 5) that is the device done. A wrong press: buttons gone 3 ticks later, and 25 ticks
 *    after it a new (in the game) sequence, shown the way the skip shows it. Practice: a wrong press
 *    restarts the run at once.
