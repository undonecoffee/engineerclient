/**
 * Renders the four teammate POV feeds and puts them on screen.
 *
 * ## What a second `renderLevel` costs
 * A preview pass is a level extract + `renderLevel`: sky, entities, block entities, particles and
 * the already-built terrain, drawn from another pair of eyes into an offscreen target. The terrain
 * upkeep (frustum cull, occlusion graph, view area, translucency sort) also runs inside those two
 * calls; a pass keeps all of it on YOUR camera (`PovLevelExtractorMixin`, `PovLevelRendererMixin`,
 * the lent captured frustum), so a pass does not redo that work.
 *
 * ## Where the two halves of the feature sit in a frame
 * ```
 * GameRenderer.extract
 *   -> extractGui -> HUD elements                (vanilla HUD, every Odin HUD)
 *   -> screen extract -> ScreenEvent.Render
 *        PovPreviews' handler, priority above Odin's CustomGUIImpl:
 *          [onScreenExtract] allocate feeds, submit the four quadrant blits,
 *                            re-submit the "keep on top" HUDs above them
 *        CustomGUIImpl -> Odin's leap boxes, EC's ring   (submitted after us -> on top)
 * GameRenderer.render
 *   -> renderLevel  HEAD   [beforeLevelRender]   Skip Own View: run the passes, cancel the main one
 *                   RETURN [afterLevelRender]    otherwise: run the passes after the main one
 *   -> guiRenderer.render                        the blits above are drawn HERE, in submit order
 * ```
 * The blit is *submitted* before the feeds are rendered and *drawn* after, so it always shows the
 * current frame — but it also means the feed targets must not be recreated between the two. They
 * are only ever allocated or freed in [onScreenExtract].
 *
 * ## Layering, and why it is submit order rather than z
 * `GuiRenderState.findAppropriateNode` pushes any element that overlaps an earlier one into a
 * higher layer, so "drawn on top" is exactly "submitted later". Submitting in the screen phase
 * puts the previews above the whole HUD; the kept HUDs and Odin's leap boxes are submitted after
 * the previews, so they survive on top of them.
 *
 * ## The pass itself
 * ```
 * save   cameraEntity, window w/h, cameraType, isHudHidden, camera eye height, captured frustum,
 *        mainRenderTarget
 * pose   PovPose.begin(target, mode, ticks, partialTick)   // rewrites the entity's lerp fields
 * set    cameraEntity = teammate, cameraType = FIRST_PERSON, isHudHidden = true (no hand),
 *        window = feed size (Camera.update reads it for the aspect ratio),
 *        camera eye height = the teammate's, mainRenderTarget = feed
 * camera.update(delta)                     // aligns the shared camera with the teammate
 * captured frustum = its cull frustum     // keep YOUR culled terrain, unless Sodium re-culls
 * EntityCulling off                        // its verdicts were raytraced from your camera
 * extractWindow + extractOptions + extractCamera + levelExtractor.extract(camera)
 * gameRenderer.renderLevel(delta)          // whole pass lands in the feed
 * restore everything, in reverse
 * ```
 * then, once all the passes are done, `camera.update` + the three extract halves again with the
 * real state, so anything drawing later in the frame sees the player's camera and the real window.
 *
 * ## Why not `gameRenderer.extract(delta, true)`
 * That is the SecurityCraft recipe, but it also runs
 * `extractGui`, which resets the frame's `GuiRenderState` — including the blits we just submitted —
 * and replays every screen and HUD handler a second time with the POV window size. Calling the
 * three private extract halves instead leaves the GUI state completely untouched.
