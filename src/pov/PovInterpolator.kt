 * The time machine behind [PovPose]'s CUSTOM mode: a per-player ring of packet targets stamped
 * with wall-clock nanos, and the lerp that reads the pose back out at an arbitrary past instant.

 * Deliberately free of Minecraft types — [PovPose] is the thin layer
 * that reads the entity's fields into [sample] and writes [poseAt] back out.
 *
 * Thread confinement: the client thread samples and the same thread renders, so no locking.
