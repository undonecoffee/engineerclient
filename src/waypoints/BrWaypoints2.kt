/**
 * Boxes that group a room's starred mobs, made on undonecoffee.com/brroles and pulled from there.
 *
 * A starred mob whose body overlaps a box where it was first seen is claimed by that box (the box
 * it overlaps most, if several); one in no box goes to the nearest box in its room within 5
 * blocks. Boxes are purple and show only in the room you are in; a box hides once all its mobs
 * are dead or the map shows the room cleared (never deleted).
 *
 * Boxes are saved per room, relative to the room, so they come back in any run and any rotation.
 *
 * Roles ([BrRoles]): once the party has said who kills what ("!3br 2" in party chat), a room the
 * rush comes into through a door the site has a plan for shows your boxes green, numbered in the
 * order you kill them, and your stack gold; everyone else's are not drawn. The door runner
 * ("!br d") sees no boxes while rushing.
