/**
 * Blood rush roles: who kills which of a room's BR Roles boxes, set on the site
 * (undonecoffee.com/brroles) for each room, each door the rush can come in through, and each number
 * of players killing (2-4), with a separate set for M7. Each role has its boxes, in the order
 * they are killed, and its stack: boxes it helps with once its own are done. There is always a door runner besides, who only rushes
 * the doors and kills nothing - or, with Doorer Kills, kills too: the site keeps those plans apart
 * (a set for M7 and one for the other floors), each for an entry door and the room's wither door,
 * with the door runner the last role.
 *
 * Each player sets how many kill (duo 2, trio 3, quad 4) and their own role in BR Roles's
 * settings, for a team that runs together. Party chat overrides that for a run, for pickup groups:
 * "!3br 2" is "3 of us are killing, I am role 2", "!br 2" the same at the team size already set,
 * "!br d" (or "!3br d") is "I am on the door". A claim lasts until the dungeon ends. Everyone
 * with the mod keeps track of who has what, and anyone without a role yet is offered the free ones as clickable buttons (they run /brrole).
